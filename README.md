## Repository Structure

- `/nginx`: Nginx configuration files
- `/transcendance-backend`: Git submodule for the backend [repository](https://github.com/ftmjr/transcendance-backend)
- `/transcendance-frontend`: Git submodule for the frontend [repository](https://github.com/ftmjr/transcendance-frontend)

## Setup and Development

1. Clone the repository including submodules:
```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ftmjr/transcendance.git

2. To set up the project, run `docker-compose up --build`.

While developing, it's a good idea to open the submodule (either backend or frontend) in a separate editor to ensure correct linting.
